# Alignmenter (Scaffold)

Alignmenter is an evaluation toolkit for auditing AI assistants across authenticity, safety, and stability metrics. This scaffold mirrors the requirements document so implementation can grow incrementally.

## Quickstart

python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -e .[dev]
alignmenter --help
```
