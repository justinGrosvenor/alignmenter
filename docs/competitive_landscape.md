# Competitive Landscape Snapshot (Draft)

| Tool | Strengths | Gaps vs. Alignmenter |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OpenAI Evals | Native OpenAI integration, large eval catalog | Limited persona/authenticity focus, no budget-aware judge planner |
| LangSmith | Deep trace analytics, LangChain native | Less opinionated scoring, requires LangSmith account |
| Arize Phoenix | Rich monitoring dashboards, anomaly detection | Complex setup, persona calibration not core |

Action items:
- Update this table each quarter.
- Add columns for pricing/licensing and persona support once data collected.
