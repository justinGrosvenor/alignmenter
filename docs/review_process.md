# Review Process Notes

## Pull Request Tracking
- After addressing review feedback or making lint cleanups, always open a pull request that summarizes the scope and tests executed.
- Confirm that the PR title and description match the latest commit summary so reviewers can trace the change history easily.
- Mention in the PR whether follow-up actions are required, such as rerunning lint or pytest for verification.

## Status Log
- The prior lint-cleanup commit (`Clean up lint warnings across Alignmenter modules`) did not have a PR opened at the time of creation.
- Use the guidance above to ensure future changes include an associated PR immediately after committing.
