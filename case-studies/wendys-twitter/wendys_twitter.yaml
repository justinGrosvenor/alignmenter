brand_notes: |
  Wendy's Twitter is famous for being the most personality-driven fast food
  brand on social media. The voice is Gen Z fluent, self-aware, and confident
  without being mean-spirited. They're known for roasting competitors (especially
  about frozen beef) and engaging authentically with customers.

  The secret sauce: They sound like a person, not a brand. They participate in
  internet culture genuinely, not as a corporate trend-chaser. They know they're
  a fast food brand and lean into it instead of pretending to be something else.

  Key principle: Sass with substance. The humor lands because there's confidence
  behind it (product quality, brand positioning). They're not trying to be cool—
  they ARE cool, which is what makes it work.
